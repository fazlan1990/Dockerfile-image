## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Clone Repository

Navigate to your desired directory where you want your project to be in, and enter the following command.

	git clone git@bitbucket.org:aytra/slack-middleware.git

<br/>  

### 2. Setting Up Virtual Environment

Open the local repo from VS Code and follow the instructions below. Make sure that you have downloaded Python 3 for this project.

#### Create virtual environment

You may consider using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to create isolated Python environments. Python 3 has [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) which is almost the same as virtualenv.

Use the following command inside your project directory to create a virtual environment.

	python3 -m venv .venv

After you create the virtual environment, you should activate it. To activate the virtual environment use the following command.

	source .venv/bin/activate

If you activated correctly, you can see that you’re inside the virtual environment. Please check the following.

    ungi@Gihans-MacBook-Pro slack-middleware % python3 -m venv .venv
    
    ungi@Gihans-MacBook-Pro slack-middleware % source .venv/bin/activate
    
    (.venv) ungi@Gihans-MacBook-Pro slack-middleware %

<br/>


### 3. Install Dependencies

Use the following command to install all the dependencies. Please make sure that you are inside the virtual environment before installing the dependecies.

	pip install -r requirements.txt
<br/>

### 4. Update .env 

    SLACK_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
